# Advantage common for all partnerships. : 
- Taxation is only at the personal level ( personal income tax), the business doesn't have to pay taxes on revenue . ^98e002

# How to choose ?
1. Complexity
2.  Liability
3.  Taxes
	1.  Small businesses should avoid being taxed twice , hence corporation isn't ideal 
	2.  Many accountants typically advise partners to claim quarterly or biannual advances to minimize your return’s end effect.
4.  Control
	1.  Sole proprietorship or an LLC is best suited for startup owners who want to maintain sole or primary control over the company and its activities, but this can also be negotiated when developing a partnership agreement.
	2.  In the beginning , its still the same for corporations , but once the business scales it will become more board directed . 
	3.  Even for a small corporation , all the rules like board meetings and minute keepings are necessary.
5.  Capital investment
	1.  Best favored is corporation
	2.  LLC is second best favored by investors 
	3.  Partnerships and sole proprietorship have a very hard time finding funds from outside
