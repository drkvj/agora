# For the company :
Equity = Net amount of funds invested by owners + retained earnings 
or 
Equity = Assets - liabilities 


# For the individual :
It is the percentage ownership that a person holds over the comapany . 

but this is not put on paper . On legal papers , only an integral number of [[Shares]] are denoted . Which in turn would determine the actual equity that a person holds . 


# Clarification 
Equity is calculated by the number of shares you hold . They are not two different ways of setting up a corporation
